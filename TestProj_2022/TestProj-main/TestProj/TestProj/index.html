    <h1>Laboratory work 6</h1>
    <h2>Task 1</h2>
    <h3>Polindrome</h3>
    <p>
        <b> Write a function for finding the maximum length of a polindrome in a string.</b>
    </p>
    <p>
        For reference:
        A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters which reads the same backward as forward, such as madam, racecar.
        There are also numeric palindromes, particularly date/time stamps using short digits 11/11/11 11:11 and long digits 02/02/2020.
        Sentence-length palindromes may be written when allowances are made for adjustments to capital letters, punctuation, and word dividers, such as "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!",
        "Was it a car or a cat I saw?" or "No 'x' in Nixon".

        <fieldset>
            <legend>
                Something:
            </legend>
            <input type="text" id="input" size="20" value="" /> <small>Something</small><br />
        </fieldset>

    </form>
    <h2>Task 2</h2>
    <h3>Anagram</h3>
    <p>
        This is the name of a word that contains all the letters of another word in the same quantity, but in a different order.
        What should you do:
        You need to write a function that checks if two lines are anagrams, and the case of letters does not matter.
        Only characters are taken into account; spaces or punctuation are not taken into account
    </p>

        </script>
    </form>
    <h2>Task 3</h2>
    <h3>Vowel search</h3>
    <p>
        A fairly simple task that often comes across in interviews.
        What should you do:
        You need to write a function that takes a string as an argument and returns the number of vowels that are contained in the string.
        Vowels are "a", "e", "i", "o", "u".
    </p>

                Something:
            </legend>
            <input type="text" id="input" size="20" value="" /> <small>Something</small><br />
        </fieldset>
        <script>
            // Add your code here
        </script>
    </form>
    <h2>Task 4</h2>
    <h3>Fibonacci</h3>
    <p>
        A classic task that can be found in interviews of various levels. It is worth recalling that the Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers, where each subsequent is the sum of the previous two.
        So, the first ten numbers are as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34.
    </p>
    <p>
        <b>What should you do:</b>
        We need to write a function that returns the nth record in a certain sequence, and n is the number that is passed as an argument to the function.
